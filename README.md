The project is split into three jupyter notebooks. In order to run the project
you must first install jupyter notebook if you dont have it already installed.
Next run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the required libraries
needed to run the project. Next simply run the command "jupyter notebook" to start up
the notebook app. From then on you will have access to run the three seperate notebooks.
